"""Fetch and cache Canada-wide CPI series from Statistics Canada.

This script downloads table 18-10-0004-13 (Consumer Price Index by product
group, monthly, 2002=100 baseline) from Statistics Canada, filters to
Canada-wide series, and registers them in a DataService instance for
validation. The raw data is cached locally by the stats-can library in
``data/statcan/``.

Run this script once before starting a session or backtest to populate the
local cache. Re-running is safe and idempotent — the stats-can library skips
downloads when the cache is current.

Usage
-----
    uv run python scripts/fetch_cpi.py

Output
------
Prints a summary table of all registered series (series_id, date range,
number of observations).

Notes
-----
TODO: Consider generalizing this script for more flexible, user-friendly discovery. The StatCan
adapter is flexible, but callers must know the table id and member filters for the series they
want. We could add examples for a few different tables.

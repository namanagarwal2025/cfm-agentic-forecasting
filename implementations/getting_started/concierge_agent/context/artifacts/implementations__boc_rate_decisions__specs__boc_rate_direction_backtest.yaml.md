# BoC Rate Direction Backtest Spec — 2010-2024 fixed announcement dates, T-28
#
# Canonical 3-way ordered-categorical backtest: at each forecast origin
# (28 days before a BoC fixed announcement date), predict whether the Bank
# will cut, hold, or hike its target for the overnight rate at the
# announcement. Scored with RPS (task payload_type: categorical).
#
# Why a 28-day lead: on the eve of a decision the 2-year GoC yield has
# already absorbed the market consensus, so a T-1 forecast mostly reads
# market pricing off a curve. Four weeks out the decision is genuinely
# uncertain — the interesting skill is anticipating cycle turns before the
# market converges. The eve-of-decision variant is kept as a small diagnostic in
# boc_rate_direction_eve_smoke.yaml; comparing the two shows how skill
# concentrates as information arrives.
#
# Origins are EXPLICIT because BoC meetings are an irregular calendar —
# 8 dates per year that no pandas frequency alias can generate. Each origin
# is announcement_date - 28 days, so the 28-day horizon resolves exactly on
# the announcement. The minimum gap between scheduled meetings is 35 days,
# so the previous meeting's outcome is always visible at the origin.
# The origin list is derived from ../meeting_schedule.yaml; a use-case test
# asserts the two files stay consistent.
#
# Origin count : 120 (8 per year, 2010-2024)
# Coverage     : spans the 2010 + 2017-18 + 2022-23 hike cycles and the
#                2015 + 2020 + 2024 cut cycles.
# Warmup       : 8 events (the full 2009 easing cycle is visible history at
#                every origin).

description: >-
  Backtest across all 120 BoC fixed announcement dates from 2010 through
  2024. At each origin (announcement date minus 28 days) predictors emit
  probabilities over cut, hold, and hike, resolved against the derived
  direction series and scored with RPS. 2009 meetings are excluded as
  targets but visible as history.

  description: >-
    At the Bank of Canada fixed announcement date occurring 28 days after the
    forecast origin, will the Bank CUT, HOLD, or HIKE its target for the
    overnight rate? Outcome is the direction of the target-rate change at
    that announcement (any size). Announcements are at 09:45 ET; the
    forecast must be issued with information available four weeks before
    the announcement, before markets have converged on the decision.

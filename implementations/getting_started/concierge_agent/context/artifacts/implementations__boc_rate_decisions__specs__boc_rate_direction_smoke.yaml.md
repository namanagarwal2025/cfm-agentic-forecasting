# BoC Rate Direction Smoke Spec — Fast CI/Testing Backtest, T-28
#
# Three-origin subset of boc_rate_direction_backtest.yaml for running the full
# notebook pipeline cheaply during development and end-to-end testing.
# Use by setting EXPERIMENT_CONFIG = "smoke" in the notebook setup cell.
#
# The three origins span holds and cuts but no hikes: a hold (2024-04-10), the
# first cut of the 2024 easing cycle (2024-06-05), and a mid-cycle cut
# (2024-09-04) — enough to exercise categorical scoring and plotting paths
# without burning tokens on 120 LLM calls. Origins sit 28 days before each
# announcement, matching the canonical backtest lead.

    At the Bank of Canada fixed announcement date occurring 28 days after the
    forecast origin, will the Bank CUT, HOLD, or HIKE its target for the
    overnight rate? Outcome is the direction of the target-rate change at
    that announcement (any size). Announcements are at 09:45 ET; the
    forecast must be issued with information available four weeks before
    the announcement, before markets have converged on the decision.

# Smoke spec — fast laptop run over a short, post-cutoff (2025) window.
#
# Weekly origins in late 2025: after the Gemini training cutoff (~Jan 2025), so
# the LLM-Process rows in the notebook can be compared *fairly* against the
# conventional methods here. The notebook keeps its LLMP predictors ON for this
# window (the predictors cell gates them on a post-cutoff flag).
#
# This spec carries experiment design only — the window, stride/warmup, and one
# single-horizon task per target. WHICH predictors run (and all their
# hyperparameters, including the covariate panel) is configured in the notebook,
# not here. Each task targets `sp500_logret_{N}b` (the close-to-close cumulative
# log return over N business days), so forecasting it N steps ahead resolves to
# the forward N-session return.
#
# Prerequisites (warm caches to the present first):
#   uv run python scripts/fetch_sp500_market.py --refresh   # ^GSPC / ^VIX / ^IXIC
#   uv run python scripts/fetch_fred.py                     # macro covariates

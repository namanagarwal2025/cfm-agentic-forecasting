# Regime-stress spec — the 2020 COVID crash, NUMERICAL METHODS ONLY.
#
# ⚠️  Keep the notebook's LLM-Process predictors OFF for this window. 2020 is
# BEFORE the Gemini training cutoff (~Jan 2025), so an LLM has effectively
# memorised these outcomes — scoring an LLMP here measures recall, not
# forecasting, and would silently flatter it in the comparison. The numerical
# methods are cutoff-safe by construction (they only see the series up to the
# origin), so this volatile window is a perfectly valid stress test *for them* —
# it's where a covariate edge is most visible.
#
# The notebook enforces "numerical only" in code: its predictors cell gates the
# LLMP variants on a post-cutoff flag that is False for this config. Use this to
# study "when do covariates help?" among the conventional methods; use the 2025
# backtest / 2026 eval for anything involving the LLMP.

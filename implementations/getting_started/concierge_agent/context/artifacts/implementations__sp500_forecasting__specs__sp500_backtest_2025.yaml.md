```yaml
# Main backtest spec — weekly origins across 2025 (post-cutoff).
#
# 2025 is after the Gemini training cutoff (~Jan 2025), so this is the window
# where the conventional methods AND the LLM-Process can be compared *fairly* —
# the LLM has not memorised these outcomes. Mirrors the energy reference's 2025
# backtest window. Use it for open iteration; spend the protected 2026 eval
# (`sp500_eval_2026.yaml`) sparingly on your finalists.
#
# This spec carries experiment design only (window + one single-horizon task per
# target). The predictor roster and hyperparameters live in the notebook. Note
# the LLMP predictors are token-heavy over ~50 weekly origins — the notebook lets
# you trim the predictor list (or widen the stride here) before enabling them.

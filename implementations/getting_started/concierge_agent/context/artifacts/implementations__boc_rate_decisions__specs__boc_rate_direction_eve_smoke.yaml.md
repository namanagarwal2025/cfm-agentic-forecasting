# BoC Rate Direction EVE Smoke Spec — T-1 diagnostic, 3 origins
#
# Eve-of-decision companion to boc_rate_direction_smoke.yaml: same three
# meetings, origins the day before each announcement. Used in notebook 02
# (§7) for the cheap lead-time comparison (T-28 vs T-1) — the eve lead is
# kept only as this small diagnostic, not as a full backtest.
#
# The three origins span holds and cuts but no hikes: a hold (2024-04-10), the
# first cut of the 2024 easing cycle (2024-06-05), and a mid-cycle cut
# (2024-09-04) — enough to exercise categorical scoring and plotting paths
# without burning tokens on a long run.

```yaml
# Protected eval — held-out 2026 window, scored through multi_evaluate() with a budget.
#
# This is the honest scoreboard. 2026 is unambiguously after the Gemini training
# cutoff, so neither the numerical methods nor the LLM-Process can have seen the
# outcomes. Treat it as scarce: `max_runs` caps how many times the spec may be
# scored (via EvalTracker), so iterate on `sp500_backtest_2025.yaml` and spend
# this only on a curated set of finalists (chosen in the notebook's eval cell).
#
# Loaded as a MultiTargetEvalSpec: one single-horizon task per target, all under
# a single shared run budget. One multi_evaluate() call across all three
# horizons counts as ONE run against `max_runs` — the budget is keyed by
# `spec_id`, not per-horizon. The predictor roster lives in the notebook.

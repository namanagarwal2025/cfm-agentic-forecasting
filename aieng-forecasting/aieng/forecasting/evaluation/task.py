class ForecastingTask(BaseModel):
    """Defines a prediction problem, independent of how it is solved.

    A ``ForecastingTask`` specifies *what* to forecast: the target series,
    the horizon(s), the temporal resolution, and how to determine ground truth.
    It says nothing about *how* a predictor should solve the problem —
    covariate selection, gap-filling, and model choice are all predictor
    concerns.

    This separation means any two predictors (a vanilla ARIMA and a
    multi-step LLM agent) can be evaluated against the same task without
    the task needing to know anything about either of them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    task_id : str
        Unique identifier for this forecasting task.
    target_series_id : str
        The ``series_id`` (key in ``SeriesStore``) of the series to forecast.
    horizons : list[int]
        One or more horizon steps to forecast.  Horizon ``h`` means ``h``
        frequency-units ahead of the forecast origin.  For example,
        ``horizons=[18]`` on monthly data means 18 months ahead;
        ``horizons=[6, 7, 8, ..., 17]`` produces a full trajectory.

        **Backward compatibility:** you may pass ``horizon=N`` (singular, int)
        and it will be silently coerced to ``horizons=[N]``.  This keeps
        existing YAML specs, notebook code, and tests working without changes.
    frequency : str
        Pandas offset alias for the forecast frequency (e.g. ``"MS"`` for
        month-start, ``"h"`` for hourly, ``"D"`` for daily). Combined with
        ``horizons``, this determines the forecast window.
    description : str
        Human-readable description of the prediction problem.
    resolution_fn : str
        How ground truth is determined. Defaults to
        ``"observed_value_at_resolution_timestamp"``, meaning the resolution
        is the actual observed value of ``target_series_id`` at the target
        timestamp.

        .. note::
            **This field is currently a placeholder.** The evaluation harness
            always uses ``"observed_value_at_resolution_timestamp"`` regardless
            of this value. Dispatch on alternative strategies is deferred.

    Notes
    -----
    The evaluation loop is identical for backtesting and live forecasting:

    .. code-block:: text

        ForecastingTask  →  defines the question
        Predictor        →  decides how to answer it
        list[Prediction] →  the answers (one per horizon)
        Resolution       →  ground truth
        Score            →  how well each answer matched

    In backtest mode, the harness iterates over historical forecast origins.
    In live mode, it waits for the resolution date. The task definition does
    not change between modes.

    Examples
    --------
    Single horizon (equivalent to old ``horizon=18``):

    >>> task = ForecastingTask(
    ...     task_id="cpi_food_18m",
    ...     target_series_id="cpi_food_canada",
    ...     horizons=[18],
    ...     frequency="MS",
    ...     description="Forecast Canada food CPI 18 months ahead.",
    ... )

    Multi-horizon trajectory (horizons 6–17 → January through December of Y+1
    from a July origin):

    >>> task = ForecastingTask(
    ...     task_id="cpi_food_cfpr_trajectory",
    ...     target_series_id="cpi_food_canada",
    ...     horizons=list(range(6, 18)),
    ...     frequency="MS",
    ...     description="Full 12-step trajectory for CFPR average-year analysis.",
    ... )

    Backward-compatible old syntax still works:

    >>> task = ForecastingTask(
    ...     task_id="cpi_all_items_1m_ahead",
    ...     target_series_id="cpi_all_items_canada",
    ...     horizon=1,
    ...     frequency="MS",
    ...     description="Forecast Canada All-items CPI one month ahead.",
    ... )
